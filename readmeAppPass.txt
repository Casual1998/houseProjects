This is a random password generator.

This program uses only one random function. So i do some twists and turns to randomize the password.


This program in the future is supost to: 

	- Generate a file with a name and the respectful password 
	Ex: email #a/H(S87
	- Open a .txt file and add a password;
	- Define a password to a .txt file with our passwords;
